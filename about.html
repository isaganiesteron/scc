            <h4>What is this?</h4>
            <p>Speedcube competitions is a resource for organizers and competitors to know any information about a speedcube competition.</p>
            <h4>Why?</h4>
            <p>The primary purpose of this website is to help and give back to the speedcubing community. I have been part of the speedcubing community for many years and have organized a couple of competitions. While organizing competition I've found a lack of tools and resources that would greatly help with the process of organizing a speedcube competition. This website attempts to provide those tools and resources to help organize competitions which will help competitors as well.</p>
            <p>My vision for speedcube competitions goes beyond just being a set of helpful tools. The main goal is to be able to sponsor and organize speedcube competitions to make competitions more frequent and available and also to organize and sponsor competitions with FREE registraion.</p>
            <h4>What does this do?</h4>
            <p>Currently the website is in a basic version.</p>
            <p>Basic version:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Upload WCA competitor list file.</li>
              <li>Automatically organize competitors into events and groups.</li>
              <li>Change grouping of events</li>
              <li>Assign roles, change groups of competitors</li>
              <li>Add, Remove competitors</li>
              <li>Save competition state to work on later</li>
              <li>Save edited competition in CSV file</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Complete version:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>All features of the basic version</li>
              <li>User Accounts</li>
                <ul>

                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h4>Monetization</h4>
            <p>This website will try to monetize by displaying ads and hopefully through sponsored deals.</p>
            <h4>How will the income of the website be used?</h4>
            <p>The main purpose of this website is to give back to the speedcubing community. There is an opportunity for monetization but it will be to give back as well.. Profits will be used in 2 ways. The 1 item is minimal and item 2 is the most important and exciting part.</p>
